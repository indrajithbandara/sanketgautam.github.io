title: "A little step towards Open Source"
---

Well. For quite much time, there have been lot of discussion about GitHub & Open Source Softwares. 
The expanding Open Source Communities & Software developed by them serve people without any interests. It has only one aim - "To provide a software that is cheaper, reliable and has better quality".

I have developed various personal projects and worked with few developer teams, but I have never contributed to any Open Source Project so far. After last summer, I got some spare time & opportunity to deep dive into the world of Open Source and explore more about it.

I explored various Open Source Projects, and went through some huge codebases of Open Source Softwares I use in my day to day life. By doing so, I learned many things, like,  the best coding practices & standards used by different Organisations. Learned about how does the Open Source Projects maintained & their development/ release workflows.


I already had some knowledge & experience working with the version control systems (specifically, Git). Hence, I want to give it a try and contribute to some Open Source Project. I went through various Blogs, Videos and other resources to make myself comfortable with the process.

Then, I started looking for some opportunities to which I can contribute. And finally, I am planning to get started with KWoC, a month long OSS event, organised by KOSS, IIT Kharagpur. It provides a platform for Open Source Beginners to get mentored to get started with Open Source Contributions.

I am also setting up this little personal blog/ portfolio to share my personal thoughts, experiences & as a quick lookup to my work & projects.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

So, let's begin this amazing journey together & explore more awesome things, so as to make this world a better place than ever.
