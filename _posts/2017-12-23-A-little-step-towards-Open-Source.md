Well. After spending few months not doing anything much productive & recovering from health issues, I believe it's time to dive deep into the ocean of Open Source Softwares, for which I have been yearning since long time. This all started last summer, few weeks before starting the internship, I started peeking through the little window to huge OSS Community. As the time flew & I explored more, that window turned into a door & a new journey began with the astonishing world of Open Source Softwares. Now, I am all set go far long and contribute my efforts for the better of humanity!

I am just setting up this little personal blog/ portfolio to share my personal thoughts, experiences & as a quick lookup to my work & projects.

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

So, let's begin this amazing journey together & explore more amazing things, so to make this world a better place than ever.
